Secure serverless backend architecture for video games using AWS.

---

## Overview

This project proposes a **secure-by-design backend for video games**, built on **AWS serverless services** and **distributed systems principles**.

The core idea is to **move game authority from the client to the server**, preventing common issues such as score manipulation, insecure validation, and lack of traceability.

Developed as a **Final Degree Project (TFG)** at Universidad Complutense de Madrid, the architecture is designed to be **replicable and practical** beyond academia.
